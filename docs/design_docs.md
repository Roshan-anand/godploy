# Design decision made in the project

## Docker Swarm

- moved from "github.com/docker/docker/client" **(depricated)** to  "github.com/moby/moby/client"

**Docker Swarm** [ core orchestrator of the applicaiton ]

- it's like a light weight k8s, best for small to medium scale project.
- less setup with our application.
